A space vehicle 10 is steered from outer space toward the earth's atmosphere main rocket nozzle end first. An inflatable braking member 28 is deployed around the vehicle 10 by introducing gas into it. The main rocket motor 16 is ignited to produce a substantially throttled stream of gases.

"The invention provides a double-walled, annular balloon which requires less gas to inflate than its volume would indicate.

An auxiliary control system may also be used in combination with the rotating unbalanced mass device, for target acquisition, keeping the scan centered on the target, or for producing complementary motion for raster scanning. The rotating unbalanced mass makes use of a mass associated with a drive shaft, such mass having a center of gravity which is displaced from the drive shaft rotation axis. The drive shaft is driven with a substantially constant angular velocity, thereby resulting in relatively low power requirements since no acceleration or deceleration of the mass is generally involved during steady state operations.

""" The wick-interrupt temperature controlling heat pipe (WITCH) is a device for controlling the temperature of spacecraft temperature-sensitive, heat dispensing devices. A heat transporting working fluid is conveyed in saturated equilibrium with its vapor across a discontinuous internal capillary liquid wick, within a tubular cylindrical pressure vessel, from a condenser section to an evaporator section located on either side of the discontinuity. When the temperature within the WITCH rises to a predetermined level, a sliding wick located within the internal capillary liquid wick is inserted across the discontinuity by a temperature sensitive control rod, thereby allowing the heat transporting working fluid to circulate from the condenser section wick to the evaporator section wick. In this configuration, the WITCH operates identically to the """"constant-conductance heat pipe"""" commonly used. When the component's or heat pipe's temperature drops to a predetermined level the control rod contracts relative to the heat pipe vessel wall and retracts the sliding wick, again creating a wick discontinuity between the evaporator and condenser sections and thereby interrupting the flow of the heat transporting working fluid and causing evaporator dry-out and curtailment of heat pipe operation. This """"ON"""" and """"OFF"""" heat pipe operation is the means whereby temperature is actively controlled to within a narrow range while heat transport varies over a wide range.

The torque bias signal is generated by a Fourier model of the torques, updated by an adaptive tuning filter, so that successive stationkeeping maneuvers progressively adapt the amplitude and phase of the Fourier coefficients in a manner which tends to minimize the residual torque demand and attitude error.

"A process for determining an attitude measurement of a spacecraft is provided. The process employs a Horizon-Crossing Indicator (HCI) sensor 108. The process uses three time tagged crossings of the earth circle 104 to provide sufficient HCI data to determine the earth center 106. Since these observations may be infrequent, the relative attitude of the spacecraft 100 changes for each observation time. Therefore, once the integrated angular rate data, and thus the attitude relative to some reference, for the first, second and third horizon crossings is obtained, the sensor bore-sight data for each of these observations is transformed back to a known reference time. In one example, the integrated angular rate data from the third and second horizon crossings is transformed back to first horizon crossing time T1. Then, existing techniques can be applied to compute the transformation from the axes of the satellite 100 at the reference time T1 to some other axes at that time, resulting in an attitude estimate for the satellite 100.",Attitude determination with earth horizon-crossing indicators and relative-attitude propagation,2002
